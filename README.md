# List_Pagination_and_Filtering
 This project uses a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.
 Displays 10 names at a time with a navigation system - a series of links at the bottom of the page, to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time or less depending on depending on quantity.
 Project uses a 'progressive enhancement'. - The page still displays the students' names without Javascript.

 Search component:
 The list filters in real time as the user types or
 when the "Search" button is clicked, the list is filtered by student name for those that include the search value. For example, if the name Phillip is typed into the box, list all items with a name that includes Phillip. If the letter S is typed in, all items with an S in the name will show on the page.
